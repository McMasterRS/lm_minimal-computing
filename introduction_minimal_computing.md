## Minimal Computing 

Minimal computing is the idea of doing the most with the least technology possible, computing done under some set of significant constraints of hardware, software, education, network capacity, power, or other factors. Minimal computing emphasizes simplicity, efficiency, and a focus on the essential elements needed to accomplish a task or project. It seeks to make digital resources more available, particularly in constrained environments or for individuals and communities with limited access to high-end computing infrastructure.
