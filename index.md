Minimal computing refers to a set of practices aimed at simplifying digital technologies and workflows to reduce computation resource consumption and dependency on complex software structures. As a benefit, minimal computing software emphasizes long-term maintenance and results in sustainable and durable software. Minimal computing is a design that implements the principles of reusable computer code and software. 

Throughout this learning module, you will explore the principles and practices of minimal computing, a methodology focused on simplicity, accessibility and sustainability in digital projects. We will demonstrate this design when building websites, using the publicly available tool Jekyll for building websites, and GitHub Pages to host these generate websites. Using GitHub as part of the technology stack directly supports reproducible software by being free, publicly-accessible and integrated with the GitHub cloud version control system.
