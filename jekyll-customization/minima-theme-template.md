## Clone the customized Minima theme template

Make sure you have Git installed on your system. If you need help installing Git on your system please consult the official Git documentation or follow the [Introduction to Git and GitHub workshop provided by the UBC Library Research Commons](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-git/).

Once you have Git installed, you can clone the customized Minima theme template used in this learning module by opening a terminal window and running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/McMasterRS/lmr_minimal-computing
```

You will now have an `lmr_minimal-computing` repo on your local machine.
