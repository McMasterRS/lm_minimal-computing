# Selecting tools for Minimal Computing and Preservation Projects

Selecting the right tools for minimal computing or preservation projects involves balancing simplicity and functionality, which are crucial for the success and sustainability of these projects. Below we provide you with some key considerations to keep in mind when choosing tools to ensure that they align with the goals of your project and contribute to its long-term success.

## Key Consideration for Tools Selection

- ### Dependencies
    When choosing a minimal computing tool, it’s crucial to evaluate the number of additional software components it relies on to function properly. Opting for tools with fewer external dependencies can simplify maintenance and reduce potential issues. Consider asking questions such as:

    - **How many other software packages does this tool depend on?** Understanding the extent of dependencies helps gauge the complexity and potential challenges in managing the tool.

    - **What happens if one or more of these packages are no longer supported or available?** This question addresses the risk of relying on external software that might become obsolete or unsupported, which could impact the functionality of your tool.
    
    By carefully considering these factors, you can select tools that are more robust and reduce the risk of dependencies becoming outdated. Eventually, making your minimal computing site easier to manage over time.

- ### Accessibility
    It is also essential to consider the tool's hardware requirements and the accessibility of modern hardware for your users. Key questions to ask include:

    - **Does the tool require a stable and persistent internet connection to function?** Understanding the tool’s reliance on internet connectivity helps determine its usability in environments with varying network stability.

    - **Is the tool compatible with older generation hardware or software (such as Internet Explorer)?** This question assesses the tool’s flexibility and ensures it can be used by users with outdated systems.

    By addressing these considerations, you can ensure your minimal computing site is accessible for users in for environments with restricted access to high-end computing infrastructure and functional for a broader range of users, regardless of their hardware or software limitations.

- ### General Selection Criterion
    Besides the considerations above, please also consider some general selection criteria.

    - **Developer-friendliness**. Consider the ease of use and the learning curve associated with the tool. And how much time do you have in your project timeline for developers to learn a new and complex framework?

    - **Availability of Documentation and Community**. A strong community can provide valuable resources, comprehensive documentation and reliable support. This can be invaluable for troubleshooting and maximizing the tool’s potential and support network.

    - **Scalability**. Ensure the tool can scale according to your needs. It should handle increasing workloads without significant performance degradation.
