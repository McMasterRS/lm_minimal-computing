## Simply Static

A WordPress plugin designed for converting a WordPress website into a static version site. It preserves your WordPress site int HTML, CSS, JavaScript files. It excludes any dynamic functionalities that rely on server-side processing.

## Steps to use Simply Static to convert a WordPress website to a static site: 

1. **Install Simply Static** 
    1. Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard.
    2. Navigate to "Plugins" -> "Add New Plugin" 
    3. Search for "Simply Static" 
    4. Install and activate the "Simply Static" plugin.

2. **Configure Simply Static** 
    1. After activation, go to "Simply Static" -> "Settings" in your WordPress admin. 
    2. Configure the plugin settings according to your needs. This includes specifying the destination folder for the static files.

3. **Start the Generation Process**
    1. Once configured, click on the "Generate" tab in the Simply Static settings. 
    2. Click the "Generate" button to start the process of creating the static version of your site.

4. **Wait for Generation to Complete** 

    The plugin will start generating the static files for your WordPress site. This may take some time, depending on the size and complexity of your site. 

5. **Download Static Files** 

    Once the generation process is complete, you will see a link to download the static files as a ZIP archive.  

    1. Click on the link to download the ZIP file to your computer. 
    2. Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to a local directory on your computer. 

6. **Review and Upload to Hosting**
    1. Review the static files in the extracted directory to ensure everything looks correct. 
    2. Upload the contents of the extracted directory to your hosting provider or any web server that supports static files. 

Please note that while Simply Static is a straightforward option, it might not cover all aspects of a complex WordPress site, especially if your site relies heavily on dynamic content or specific plugins. Always test the static version thoroughly before fully transitioning from a dynamic WordPress site. Additionally, back up your WordPress site before starting the conversion process.
