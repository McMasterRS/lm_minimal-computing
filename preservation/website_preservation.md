# Web Archiving

Web archiving is not only about collecting and preserving websites in an archive, but it also plays a crucial role in preserving research and supporting open research. By capturing website content in an immutable and time-stamped form, web archiving ensures that valuable research materials are safeguarded for future generations. 

One of the key benefits of web archiving in the context of research preservation is its ability to create a reliable and verifiable historical record. Researchers can refer to archived web content to trace the evolution of the research. This historical continuity applies a better understanding of the progression of knowledge and facilitates the replication and validation of research results.​

Another fundamental aspect of web archiving is its adherence to the FAIR principles. By making web content findable through indexing practices, accessible through user-friendly interfaces, interoperable via different systems, and reusable with proper licensing. This facilitates data sharing, integration, and reuse, resulting in more efficient and collaborative research.

## Internet Archive Wayback Machine

*"The Internet Archive Wayback Machine is a service that allows people to visit archived versions of Web sites. Visitors to the Wayback Machine can type in a URL, select a date range, and then begin surfing on an archived version of the Web. Imagine surfing circa 1999 and looking at all the Y2K hype or revisiting an older version of your favorite Web site. The Internet Archive Wayback Machine can make all of this possible."*[2]( https://help.archive.org/help/wayback-machine-general-information/)
