# Selecting tools for Minimal Computing and Preservation Projects
Selecting the right tools for minimal computing or preservation projects involves balancing simplicity and functionality, which is crucial for the success and sustainability of these projects. Below we provide you with some key considerations to keep in mind when choosing tools to ensure that they align with the goals of your project and contribute to its long-term success.
 
## Key Consideration for Tools Selection

- ### Accessibility and Resource Efficiency
    It is better to choose tools that require minimal power consumption. Also, check if it can operate with limited internet access, that will make them more accessible for environments with restricted access to high-end computing infrastructure.

- ### Minimize Dependencies
    It is important to check the number of tool dependencies required to run the tool. You should consider selecting tools that come with minimal external dependencies. This will reduce complexity and the risk of dependencies becoming outdated over time.

- ### Community Support
    Check the availability of community support for the tool. A wide and active community can greatly help in the development process by providing support, updates, and enhancements.
    
- ### Open Source
    Open source tools allow for collaboration and long-term maintenance by ensuring that everyone can access, modify, and redeploy the software.

- ### Documentation
    A well-documented tool with clear instructions for installation, configuration, and usage can greatly assist you when integrating it into your project. Comprehensive documentation is essential for users to effectively utilize the tool without extensive training.

- ### Version Control
    Check if the tool uses a version control system like GitHub to track changes and manage updates. Version control helps in understanding the evolution of the tool and facilitates collaboration among developers.
